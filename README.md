# Terraform + Ansible AWS Infrastructure Automation

This project demonstrates how to **provision and configure AWS infrastructure automatically** using **Terraform** and **Ansible**.  
Itâ€™s part of my Cloud Engineering learning track (Week 2: *IaC + Networking + Shared Storage*).

---

##  Overview

The goal was to build a simple but production-like environment that includes:

- A **VPC** with both public and private subnets  
- An **Internet Gateway** and **Route Table** for external access  
- A **Security Group** allowing SSH and HTTP traffic  
- An **EC2 Instance** provisioned via Terraform  
- Configuration and package management handled through **Ansible**
